This is a dump of all the snippets I have collected over the last 18
months or so that I'm going to document here so it's probably going to
be a mess but it mainly for my reference so ðŸ˜›

From **Adam Wathan:**

ðŸ”¥ Ever run into annoying CSS layout bugs that are really hard to
troubleshoot? (WHY IS THERE A HORIZONTAL SCROLLBAR WHERE IS THIS
COMING FROM?!?)

Throw this style into your dev tools to quickly see the boundaries of
every element without affecting the layout:

```css
* {
  outline: 1px solid red !important;
}
```
