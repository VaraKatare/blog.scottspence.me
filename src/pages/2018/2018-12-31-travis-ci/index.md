I thought I'd set up this blog with some sort of build pipeline, the
intention was to have a good Continuous Integration pipeline so that
if there were any issues when building the site that I wouldn't push a
broken build. No one wants to see that ðŸ˜¿

### WTF are you talking about Scott?

Ok, so Travis is a service that will build

### What I'm using

* Zeit's now

* Gatsby

* Travis DUH!

I love Zeit's now

Travis ðŸ‘Œ

Tried now pipline ðŸ’©

##### folder and frontmatter path names

make sure that your folder names are not the same as your frontmatter
path names
