I thought I'd set up this blog with some sort of build pipeline, the
intention was to have a good Continuous Integration pipeline so that
if there were any issues when building the site that I wouldn't push a
broken build. No one wants to see that ðŸ˜¿

### What I'm using

* Zeit's now

* Gatsby

* Travis DUH!

### How the set-up works

I have my GitHub project set up with two branches `master` and
`development` changes are made on feature branch of `development` then
pushed up to `master` once I'm happy the change is ok to go to
production.

#### the flow

Issue is "Add self hosted Fonts #75" I'll make a branch from git and
give it a name to reflect the issue number
`dev/75/add-self-hosted-fonts` I'll make my changes locally then push
to the `development` branch.

My `travis.yml` looks like this:

```yml
sudo: false

language: node_js

cache:
  directories:
    - node_modules

notifications:
  email: false

node_js:
  - '9'

before_script:
  - npm prune

script:
  - npm i -g now@canary
  - npm run clean
  - npm run build
  - npm run deploy

after_script:
  - if [ "$TRAVIS_BRANCH" = "development" ]; then npm run alias:dev; fi
  - if [ "$TRAVIS_BRANCH" = "master" ]; then npm run alias:prod; fi
  - if [ "$TRAVIS_BRANCH" = "master" ]; then npm run release; fi
  - npm run cleanup
