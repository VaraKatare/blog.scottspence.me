I'm going to go over steps I have taken the help me with learning to
code ([again])

But fist, **preamble:**

## Letâ€™s pick up a new skill, get a new job, all in a few months.

That was the overriding message I got when I started out in
freeCodeCamp it's a fun and exciting time and you will see a lot of
articles along the lines of 'hey look at me I was a school teacher
before now I'm earning $100k as a engineer for x startup'

I don't mean this in a mean spirited or passive aggressive way, but if
you're starting out in web development and you surround yourself with
other people that want to achieve, they will, you know, achieve! ðŸ™ƒ

I'm not going to go into the

There's a bit of expectation vs reality here, if you are the kind of
person that can memorize the masses of information out there relating
to your chosen field then you're onto a winner, as for myself it's
repetition, repetition, repetition until it becomes habit, there's a
lot to be said about habits.

December 26th 2016 was when I decided to take part in the
<span>#100DaysOfCode</span> challenge I

Patience is needed, instant gratification doesnâ€™t work here, well at
least not for me. When I finished my last contract I used that time to
fully immerse myself in web development. At the time (which was quite
good timing actually) I started a build to learn project with two
other remote developers one in Egypt and one in Serbia. I got to treat
this time as a full time job which my WakaTime stats will attest.

I get distracted, things like apps for slack and email and Twitter
should not be opened, this will eat up your time.

Get up early, I've taken to getting up an hour earlier than I used to
to squeeze an hour and a half out of the morning, I have a MI band
that I have set to vibrate to wake me at that time so I do not disturb
my wife

Go to bed early, sleep is important kids, anyone that says otherwise
obviously doesn't get enough sleep ðŸ™ƒ

Make time, people saying that they can't find time to do x in reality
are making excuses, you're the only one that can make these things
happen.

Love your family

Have a job? Thatâ€™s not an excuse, had a crappy day, just want to sit
on the sofa and veg out, that is time you can be spending learning and
also time you can be enjoying some downtime with your significant
other which is equally as important to your well-being

Itâ€™s a balance
