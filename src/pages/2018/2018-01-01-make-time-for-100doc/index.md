Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you
could miss it. — Ferris Bueller.

Let’s pick up a new skill, get a job, all in a few months.

Patience is needed, instant gratification doesn’t work here

I get distracted, things like apps for slack and email and Twitter should not be
opened, this is eat up your time.

Get up early

Go to bed early

Make time

Love your family

Have a job? That’s not an excuse, had a crappy day, just want to sit on the sofa
and veg out, that is time you can be spending learning and also time you can be
enjoying some downtime with your significant other which is equally as important
to your well-being

It’s a balance
