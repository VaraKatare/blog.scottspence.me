Up until around November last year I didn't like styling anything at
all with CSS, it was a chore rather than something I enjoyed doing.

Customary gif of Perter Griffin messing around with the venetian
blinds. I'm not going to add it, everyone is sick of seeing it I'm
sure üòÅ.

That was until I used styled-components with my team on the Chingu
build to learn project we worked on, Marina in particular was such an
inspiration for me watching how components were styled and really gave
me the confidence to start using CSS-in-JS.

I want to share what I have learned so far by going through styling a
basic react application.

‚òùÔ∏è so, to be clear, this is what I have learned so far and this will
probably change as a learn more.

There's some basic CSS concepts in this post that I was not aware of
before starting out with styled-components that I presume are assumed
in styling web pages.

### Install styled-components

Ok lets bootstrap the basic react application you get when using
[Create React App] with [`npx`], if you have Create React App
installed globally then you can use the command without `npx`.

```sh
npx create-react-app style-with-styled-components
```

`cd` into the project via the terminal and install styled-components

```sh
style-with-styled-components/
# or
# cd style-with-styled-components/ if you don't use fish shell
npm i styled-components
```

Ok, we have the basic app we can style, thankfully Dan has kindly
provided the starting styles for us so let's begin my using them with
styled-components

We can start with the `App.js` file and it's accompanying `App.css`
file. Let's take a look at the `App.js` first:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import logo from './logo.svg'
import './App.css'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
        </header>
        <p className="App-intro">
          To get started, edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to
          reload.
        </p>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default App
```

The five `className`'s in there `App`, `App-header`, `App-logo`,
`App-title` and `App-intro` we're going to replace with our
styled-components, so let's make a component for each of the classes
and copy pasta the CSS in from `App.css`

The way the CRA CSS is assumes that you will have a corresponding CSS
file for each component, which can help with maintaining the CSS and
lends to the React idea of having all your files separated into their
component parts.

So let's do one component first to get an idea of where we're going
with this.

First, import `styled` into the `App.js` module:

```js
import styled from 'styled-components'
```

Now lets look at **`<AppWrapper className="App">`**, it's the top
level div for this component and is what I like to call the wrapper
for the component. So lets give it an imaginative name `AppWrapper`.
Referring to the `App.css` there is `text-align: center;` which
belongs to this, so:

```js
const AppWrapper = styled.div`
  text-align: center;
`
```

So here we have defined the `AppWrapper` const as a `styled.div`
followed by back ticks `` inside of the back ticks we can write any
regular CSS with the exact same syntax.

Now that we have our `AppWrapper` we can replace the top level div on
the `App.js` component.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

import logo from './logo.svg'
import './App.css'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <AppWrapper>
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
        </header>
        <p className="App-intro">
          To get started, edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to
          reload.
        </p>
      </AppWrapper>
    )
  }
}

export default App
```

### styled-components all the things

So let's do that for the remaining four CSS classes, and take a look:

```js
const rotate360 = keyframes`
  from { 
    transform: rotate(0deg); 
  }
  to { 
    transform: rotate(360deg); 
  }
`

const AppLogo = styled.img`
  animation: ${rotate360} infinite 120s linear;
  height: 80px;
`

const AppHeader = styled.div`
  background-color: #222;
  height: 150px;
  padding: 20px;
  color: white;
`

const AppTitle = styled.h1`
  font-size: 1.3em;
`

const AppIntro = styled.p`
  font-size: large;
`
```

So first off we've created a variable for the React svg [animation],
you'll need to import the `keyframes` helper from styled-components
like: `import styled, { keyframes } from 'styled-components'` this can
now be used throughout the component and we can add an on `hover` to
the component as well to illustrate using `hover` in a component.

```js
const AppLogo = styled.img`
  animation: ${rotate360} infinite 120s linear;
  height: 80px;
  &:hover {
    animation: ${rotate360} infinite 1.5s linear;
  }
`
```

Ok, our app shouldn't look any different as we haven't added in our
styled-components to the app `render()` method, so let's do that now.
Let's also change the intro text. You can add a wrapper for the
`<code>` tags something like:

```js
const CodeWrapper = styled.code`
  font-size: 1.3rem;
`
```

But if you prefer you can nest selectors within the component, like:

```js
const AppIntro = styled.p`
  color: ${props => props.theme.dark};
  font-size: large;
  code {
    font-size: 1.3rem;
  }
`
```

Let have a look at the `render()` method now...

```js
render() {
  return (
    <AppWrapper>
      <AppHeader>
        <AppLogo src={logo} alt="logo" />
        <AppTitle>Welcome to React</AppTitle>
      </AppHeader>
      <AppIntro>
        Bootstrapped with <code>create-react-app</code>.
      </AppIntro>
      <AppIntro>
        Components styled with <code>styled-components</code>{' '}
        <EmojiWrapper aria-label="nail polish">üíÖ</EmojiWrapper>
      </AppIntro>
    </AppWrapper>
  )
}
```

Now all the classes originally used in `App.js` have been replaced so
there's no need for the `import './App.css'` mapping, remove that
aaaaand! Still no change!! üòÅ Cool, we have now replaced all the css
with styled-components, now we can take a look at `injectGlobal`.

Lets take a look at how the `App.js` file should look before we move
on:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import styled, { keyframes } from 'styled-components'

import logo from './logo.svg'

const AppWrapper = styled.div`
  text-align: center;
`

const rotate360 = keyframes`
  from { 
    transform: rotate(0deg); 
  }
  to { 
    transform: rotate(360deg); 
  }
`

const AppLogo = styled.img`
  animation: ${rotate360} infinite 120s linear;
  height: 80px;
  &:hover {
    animation: ${rotate360} infinite 1.5s linear;
  }
`

const AppHeader = styled.div`
  background-color: #222;
  height: 12rem;
  padding: 1rem;
  color: white;
`

const AppTitle = styled.h1`
  font-weight: 900;
`

const AppIntro = styled.p`
  font-size: large;
  code {
    font-size: 1.3rem;
  }
`

const EmojiWrapper = styled.span.attrs({
  role: 'img'
})``

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <AppWrapper>
        <AppHeader>
          <AppLogo src={logo} alt="logo" />
          <AppTitle>Welcome to React</AppTitle>
        </AppHeader>
        <AppIntro>
          Bootstrapped with <code>create-react-app</code>.
        </AppIntro>
        <AppIntro>
          Components styled with <code>styled-components</code>{' '}
          <EmojiWrapper aria-label="nail polish">üíÖ</EmojiWrapper>
        </AppIntro>
      </AppWrapper>
    )
  }
}

export default App
```

### Style the body with `injectGlobal`

For styling the body of our react app we currently have the
`index.css` file that is being imported into the mounting point of our
app in the `index.js` file.

To style the body we can use [`injectGlobal`] from styled-components
which adds the styles directly to the stylesheet.

To do this you bring in the `injectGlobal` named export from
styled-components and add your styles between the back ticks.

```js
body {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

Let's add a `theme` folder in `src` directory and add a
`globalStyle.js` file where we can keep all our styles we want to use
throughout the app.

In `src/theme/globalStyle.js` we'll need to import the `injectGlobal`
named export from styled-components:

```js
import { injectGlobal } from 'styled-components'

injectGlobal`

  body {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    font-family: sans-serif;
  }
`
```

Ok, now we're adding the body style to the stylesheet directly so
there is no need for the `index.css` file mapping that is in
`index.js` it should look like this now:

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

import App from './App'
import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker'

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
registerServiceWorker()
```

We should still have our nice `sans-serif` font going on, but let's
add in some nice Roboto for the body and Montserrat for the heading in
our `globalStyle.js` module. We can import Google fonts with an
`@import` in `injectGlobal` and apply Roboto to the body:

```js
injectGlobal`

  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat|Roboto');

  body {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;
  }
`
```

Cool now we can add our imported font for or app header, and there's
the option if we want all our `<h1>`'s to use the same font we can add
that to the `injectGlobal` in our `globalStyles.js` module.

```js
injectGlobal`

  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat:400,900|Roboto');

  body {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;
  }

  h1 {
    font-family: Montserrat;
  }
`
```

Then we can adjust the weight on the `AppTitle` component:

```js
const AppTitle = styled.h1`
  font-weight: 900;
`
```

To add the additional styles for fonts like Montserrat and Roboto you
can specify them in the `@import url()` you'll notice that Montserrat
has `:400,900` after it that is specifying the styles regular (400)
and black (900), you can import as many as you like from Google fonts
(CDN) but the more you import the longer it will take to load them, if
you have a lot of fonts and styles you want in your app then consider
adding them to a folder in the project, like:

```js
import Montserrat from './fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf'

injectGlobal`
  @font-face {
    font-family: Montserrat;
    src: url(${Montserrat});
  }
`
```

## Use `ThemeProvider`

Now say we want to have several components in our app that use a CSS
colour property `color: #6e27c5` instead of hard coding it through the
app for every component that uses it we can use the styled-components
`ThemeProvider`.

For this we will need to import the `ThemeProvider` named export from
styled-components, then define a `theme` object where our colour is
going to live:

```js
export const theme = {
  primary: '#6e27c5'
}
```

I'm going to add the theme object to my `globalStyle.js` module with
the rest of the styles.

To make the theme object available throughout the app component we'll
wrap our app component in the `ThemeProvider` and import our awesome
theme for use in the `ThemeProvider`:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import styled, { keyframes, ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'

import logo from './logo.svg'

import { theme } from './theme/globalStyle'

// our styled-components

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
        <AppWrapper>{/* ...styled-components... */}</AppWrapper>
      </ThemeProvider>
    )
  }
}

export default App
```

Now the `theme` properties can be used as props in our
styled-components, let's change the `background-color:` in the
`AppHeader` component, whilst we're at it let's add a `dark:` property
to our `theme` object and use that for the `color:` property:

```js
const AppHeader = styled.div`
  height: 12rem;
  padding: 1rem;
  color: ${props => props.theme.dark};
  background-color: ${props => props.theme.primary};
`
```

Now we can change our app theme globally üëç lets take a look at that
now as well.

**ThemeSelect.js**

```js
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const Select = styled.select`
  margin: 2rem 0.5rem;
  padding: 0rem 0.5rem;

  width: 50%;
  text-align: center;

  font-family: Roboto;
  font-size: 1rem;

  border: 1px dashed ${props => props.theme.light};
  box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  background: ${props => props.theme.light};
  border-radius: 2px;
`

export const SelectOpt = styled.option`
  font-family: Roboto;
  font-size: 1rem;
`

class ThemeSelect extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Select onChange={e => this.props.handleThemeChange(e)}>
          <SelectOpt value="theme1">Theme 1</SelectOpt>
          <SelectOpt value="theme2">Theme 2</SelectOpt>
        </Select>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default ThemeSelect
```

**App.js**

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import styled, { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'

import logo from './logo.svg'

import { theme1, theme2 } from './theme/globalStyle'
import ThemeSelect from './components/ThemeSelect'

const AppWrapper = styled.div`
  text-align: center;
`

const AppHeader = styled.div`
  height: 12rem;
  padding: 1rem;
  color: #000;
  background-color: #fafafa;
  color: ${props => props.theme.dark};
  background-color: ${props => props.theme.primary};
`

const AppTitle = styled.h1``

const AppLogo = styled.img`
  animation: App-logo-spin infinite 120s linear;
  height: 80px;
  @keyframes App-logo-spin {
    from {
      transform: rotate(0deg);
    }
    to {
      transform: rotate(360deg);
    }
  }
  &:hover {
    animation: App-logo-spin infinite 1s linear;
  }
`

const AppIntro = styled.p`
  /* color: ${props => props.theme.dark}; */
  font-size: large;
`

const EmojiWrapper = styled.span.attrs({
  role: 'img'
})``

const CodeWrapper = styled.code`
  font-size: 1.3rem;
`

class App extends Component {
  state = {
    theme: theme1
  }
  handleThemeChange = e => {
    let theme = e.target.value
    theme === 'theme1' ? (theme = theme1) : (theme = theme2)
    this.setState({ theme })
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <ThemeProvider theme={this.state.theme}>
        <AppWrapper>
          <AppHeader>
            <AppLogo src={logo} alt="logo" />
            <AppTitle>Welcome to React</AppTitle>
          </AppHeader>
          <AppIntro>
            To get started, edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to
            reload.
          </AppIntro>
          <ThemeSelect handleThemeChange={this.handleThemeChange} />
        </AppWrapper>
      </ThemeProvider>
    )
  }
}

export default App
```

Transcript from DM convo about this article

**Me:**

I'm thinking about how to put this styled components post together

For a beginner Like me, there's a few bits which I've learned

I don't want to be giving people the wrong information

**Phill:**

Hiya :) I can review your post if you‚Äôd like? Or do you need some more
ideas too to pull it together?

**Me:**

Well, I don't have anything down yet but from doing a couple of sites
now I use the following:

A global style module that has the theme object in there and media
queries and predefined h1-h6 LIs ULs and P

Then pass props to the components for the theme

Use the theme provider

Anything else??

Phil:

Sounds good :)

So a more styled theming targeted article if I get this correctly?

**Me:**

Yeah, was that not what you wanted?

Phil:

Oh that is definitely one of the things üëå

**Me:**

So, am I missing something?

Just got to say I hated styling things in CSS until I started using
styled-components

or CSS-in-JS

Not given anything else a go really, well apart from the Zeit one they
have

Phil:

No I think that‚Äôd be a great guide ‚ú®

I‚Äôd just love to have some guides on the order of styled components in
the component tree too

**Me:**

Whats that then?

Component tree?

**Phill:**

So I‚Äôve seen a couple of patterns that can greatly break what styled
components is good at

**Me:**

The format I'm taking for the last three sites now is use theme and
injectGlobal

**Phill:**

let‚Äôs say you have a const Form = () => <A>...</A> Where the children
are styled Then wrapping it like styled(Form) is an anti pattern since
st that point the classname becomes exposed and the styles of the
elements in the Form might be mixed which breaks encapsulation

**Me:**

I have in some instances predefined headings and p's

this time around I'm not

Because I found that I was always overriding what I had predefined
anyway

I'm thinking this time around if I see the same pattern then I guess
i'll farm it off to the globalStyle module

**Phill:**

Yea but then you could write styled(A) and use that instead and that‚Äôd
be fine, but styled(Form) targets a ‚Äústructural component‚Äù (or even a
container; who knows)

**Me:**

I've not done anything with forms yet

**Phill:**

So that‚Äôs a pattern I‚Äôve seen a couple of times but it spreads your
styles across multiple levels where you can‚Äôt refactor and follow them
anymore

**Me:**

Ah ok, well I guess I'm learning as I go, but that's the sort of thing
I want to avoid

**Phill:**

It‚Äôs just an example name; not forms specifically

**Me:**

Phil!

I'm sorry, I do apologise, I didn't see this:

```philp
Then wrapping it like styled(Form) is an anti pattern since st that point
the classname becomes exposed and the styles of the elements in the
Form might be mixed which breaks encapsulation
```

**Phill:**

üòâ So when I need a variant that‚Äôs like A in the example I‚Äôd do three
things:

**Me:**

I guess you're always going to have the possibility of that happening

**Phill:**

* is it a generic change that‚Äôs common? => introduce a prop in A that
  switches it around

* is it specific but kind of common? => move the styled(A) variant to
  where A is and export it there

* and lastly: move the variant to where it‚Äôs used (where Form is in
  the example)

So there‚Äôs really no need for styled(Form) and it also encourages
descendant selectors which are :(

**Me:**

Awesome!!

These are great points! But when you are piecing something together
for the first time this sort of thing isn't immediately obvious, well,
for me anyway

**Phill:**

It‚Äôs not unfortunately üòÖ So that‚Äôs why an article on it would be
awesome üòé

**Me:**

I have always used DRY, never knew it was called DRY before starting
to learn webdev but it irks me to have stuff repeated everywhere

**Phill:**

Yea this practice is not that obvious unfortunately

https://twitter.com/_philpl/status/953029683830054915

This might be the shortest explanation of what you‚Äôd do if you do
styled(Form)

Or like Erik puts it ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no element to style‚Äù

Or like in our example, there is no _single_ element to style

I hope this gives you some ideas for the article üò¨

**Me:**

Yes!

There's loads to put in there thanks Phil, I'm pulling what we've
discussed here [thanks for taking the time to discuss it with me by
the way] and what I have learned over the last month now and I'll add
as a go along with styling my portfolio site as well

Max and yourself aren't in any hurry to have the information are you?
