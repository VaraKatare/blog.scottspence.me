I wasn't sure on the process of getting your own API data into Gatsby
or if you could do it at all! Turns out you can and it wasn't that
much of a ballache to get set up either.

I wanted to be able to get some JSON data and display that in Gatsby

When Gatsby builds it pulls the data from where you and then creates
it statically

I made an example here that gets JSON data from an external source and
creates the pages from that
