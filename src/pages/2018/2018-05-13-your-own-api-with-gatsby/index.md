I wasn't sure if you could use any data you wanted in Gatsby to build
yourself a super duper fast site.

I wanted to be able to get some JSON data and display that in Gatsby

When Gatsby builds it pulls the data from where you and then creates
it statically

I made an example here that gets JSON data from an external source and
creates the pages from that
