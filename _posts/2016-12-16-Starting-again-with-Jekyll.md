Since setting up this blog I haven't really bothered with Jekyll any more than just forking Barry Clarke's repo of Jekyll Now and adding these posts as and when the feeling takes me, I decided that I wanted my blog to look a bit more like Barry's blog

## Confusing
Jekyll uses Liquid templating language which, for someone like me was a bit confusing. With me just getting used to the layout of a 'standard' web page I was then presented with liquid 'tags' something I'm still not completely clear on what dome of them do.   

## CSS
For some reason I thought that a Jekyll page didn't use CSS, well the reason was there was nothing like that in the 'vanilla' Jekyll site when you run the ```jekyll new myblog``` you get very little in the was of bells and whistles

Running the following from the terminal on my Ruby development box

```
~ $ gem install jekyll bundler
~ $ jekyll new myblog
~ $ cd myblog
~/myblog $ bundle exec jekyll serve
# => Now browse to http://localhost:4000
```

You get this:
