Hi my name is Scott, I'm an Analyst Developer with the main skills of VBA and SQL, I want to change this so have decided to self educate myself on other general programming languages and web development.

If you're interested this blog details various notes on my experiences with programming and technology and the odd rant.

### What I’m doing now

* Working as an (Analyst Developer) IT contractor
* Learning JavaScript and also taking the [#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) challenge.
* Learning with [FreeCodeCamp()](https://www.freecodecamp.com) for a full web stack web developer certification.
* Back at the gym three times a week with 531
* Writing posts for [spences10.github.io](https://spences10.github.io)
