Hi my name is Scott, I'm an Analyst Developer with the main skills of VBA and SQL, I want to change this so have decided to self educate myself on other general programming languages and web development.

If you're interested this blog details various notes on my experiences with programming and technology and the odd rant.

I'm currently learning with [FreeCodeCamp()](https://www.freecodecamp.com) and also taking the [#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) challenge.

This site is powered by Jekyll using the default theme minima which I have amended for my own purposes from looking at other Jekyll sites and themes

You can find out more info about customizing your own Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for the Jekyll new theme at:
{% include icon-github.html username="jekyll" %} /

You can find the source code for Jekyll at
{% include icon-github.html username="jekyll" %} /
