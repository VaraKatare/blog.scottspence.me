## preamble

Let's not try to get too cynical here but let's just get it out there
to start with. Technical recruitment is fucked!

Let's call it job hunting fatigue, as we as developers have fatigues
in other areas, but this isn't one of our own making.

Starting out your job hunt getting your CV out there will generate a
lot of calls where the most irrelevant keyword on your CV will
generate unwanted calls from what appear to be desperate recruiters.

Ok, that's a bit harsh! it's the truth, Ruth!

Getting a good candidate a lot of the time revolves around word of
mouth.

Being a developer you begin to notice patterns with the increasing
call you get, the same questions get asked over and over. Also as a
developer you want to keep things [DRY] to save yourself and the
recruiter a bit of time.

Beginning a job hunt is quite daunting searching Google

making a site, this is more for prospective employers rather than
recruiters and although the majority of them will talk to you as
though they are the ones considering you for the role they're only the
first stage in what can be a quite lengthy process.
