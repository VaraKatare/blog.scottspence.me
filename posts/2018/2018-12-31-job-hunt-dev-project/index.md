## preamble

Let's not try to get too cynical here but let's just get it out there
to start with. Technical recruitment is fucked!

Let's call it job hunting/finding talent fatigue, as we as developers
have fatigues in other areas, but this isn't one of our own making.

Starting out your job hunt getting your CV out there will generate a
lot of calls where the most irrelevant keyword on your CV will
generate unwanted calls from what appear to be desperate recruiters.

Ok, that's a bit harsh! it's the truth, Ruth!

Getting a good candidate a lot of the time revolves around word of
mouth.

Being a developer you begin to notice patterns with each call you get,
the same questions get asked over and over. Also as a developer you
want to keep things [DRY] to save yourself and the recruiter a bit of
time.

Beginning a job hunt is quite daunting searching Google

making a site, this is more for prospective employers rather than
recruiters and although the majority of them will talk to you as
though they are the ones considering you for the role they're only the
first stage in what can be a quite lengthy process.

making a cv, I went to the effort to make a basic site using my
favourite tech stack [teh JAMStack behbeh!]

In my mind this gave my current skill level with styling and preferred
stack, in reality no one gives a shit as long as it looks nice and
recruiters even less so because it doesn't answer the questions they
want to ask

google analytics's, used it

numbers game, it seems that recruitment firms still believe that
quantity will result in quality. I do understand the "turn over every
stone" mindset until you find that gem in all the chaff. It seems that
the vast majority of recruiters have misunderstood this aspect of
finding quality candidates and rather than find a good dataset to
start with just go all out scatter-gun approach to meet their daily
KPI.

being civil

play the game, so bearing in mind the numbers game you have to go in
with that expectation. So you go and add your CV to all the job boards
you will undoubtedly get some irrelevant calls. But you will also get
calls which match specifics to your job hunt.
