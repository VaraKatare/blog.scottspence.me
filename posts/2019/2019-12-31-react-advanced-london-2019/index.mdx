React Advanced London going deep!

## Ken Wheeler - React Performance

Ken's keynote didn't disappoint! Ken talks about how performance fixes
aren't prescriptive and it's more like a puzzle to figure out.

To help with this he prescribed the IMDOPE system!

> ### IMDOPE System
>
> - **I**dentify that a problem exists
> - **M**easure your timings
> - **D**evelop a plan
> - **O**pen dev tools
> - **P**lay around until its better
> - **E**njoy newly performant app

Ken detailed an animation running at 60 frames per second and how that
appears on the performance tab.

The user Timings API (which I've never heard of) lets you define
precise performance marking that you can name and display in dev
tools.

**Example:**

```bash
performance.mark('mainthread-start')
# do expensive things for performance
performance.mark('mainthread-stop')
performance.measure('mainthread', 'mainthread-start', 'mainthread-stop')
```

React does not control renders by default, very often problems
relating to performance are related to unnecessary renders.

React is _generally_ not great when you have a lot of components
rendering and re-rendering at the same time (cough React Memo!)

The React dev tools profiler got a mention and there was a demo of how
react will re-render all the things if you have many components in a
view using the React dev tools profiler.

There was an amusing part where when trying to demo the `useCallback`
React API where Ken missed out the second argument and had to consult
the React docs to clarify.

List should be virtualized, check out Brian Vaughn's [React Window] or
[React Virtualized] he went on to render lists with 10k plus items in
there and demoed the shoddy performance on a rendered list then with
react window.

**Web Workers**

A particularly interesting section for me (because I didn't know it
was a thing), with web workers you can take expensive tasks off of the
main thread.

There are some downsides to this relating to serialization though.

**WASM**

He finished up with an auto tune example made with Rust and a Google
audio worklet to process a stream of audio to do the Daft Punk "one
more time" vocoder example! Dope!

## Sean Wang - React (with hooks) from scratch

Bonkers talk from Sean where he recreated React with Hooks and React
Concurrency (Fibre) in a [CodeSandbox.io] session.

The talk was a sequel to a previous talk on [React hooks from scratch]
in 29 lines. He started with "we're going to re-create concurrent
React in 130 lines of code!".

At blazing fast speed he covered many concepts, a lot I was unfamiliar
with relating to React, topics covered:

- React Fiber
- "Rendering"
- Linked List Traversal
- Reconciliation vs Commit
- `useState` hook
- Work loop
- Suspense

First, the POJO! (Plain Old JavaScript Object):

```js
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    children: 'Hello world',
  },
};
```

Then went on to define what a fiber was, which is an extension on the
POJO:

```js
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    children: 'Hello world',
  },
  dom: domNode,
  parent: parentFiber,
  child: childFiber,
  sibling: null,
  alternate: currentFiber,
  effectTag: PLACEMENT,
  hooks: [],
};
```

I'll be honest, the speed at which Sean went, although very concise
was quite though to follow at times.

He covered all the main sections along with code examples. TL;DR
suspense with time slicing is here.

The only dependency used in the code was Babel with this [fetch
example] where the we're using state and reading from a resource which
suspends (or caches) as needed.

## Vojtech Miksu - What a Drag

Vojtech (Uber) goes through the history lesson about drag and drop and
the complexities that come with it.

He details the options available and why they implemented their own
[React Movable] Accessible drag and drop project.

Here's the same talk from RSCONF 2019:
