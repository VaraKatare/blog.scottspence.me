In this guide we're going to cover converting the Gatbsy default blog
starter to use MDX.

All the cool kids are using Gatsby and MDX in their blogs these days.
If you already have a blog that uses Gatsby but want to move onto the
new hotness then this is the guide for you.

## Versions:

**This guide is being used with the following dependency versions.**

- gatsby: 2.3.5
- react: 16.8.6
- react-dom: 16.8.6
- gatsby-mdx: 0.4.5
- @mdx-js/mdx: 0.20.3
- @mdx-js/tag: 0.20.3

You can also check out the [example code].

We're going to need some links, which are:

CodeSandbox: https://codesandbox.io/docs/importing

[CodeSandbox import wizard]

Gatsby starter blog: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog

## Import to CodeSandbox

For this example I'm going to be using the [Gatsby starter blog] and
importing it into CodeSandbox, you can do this with the import wizard
linked, paste the link in there and CodeSandbox will open the
representation on the code on GitHub.

Import deps:

- `gatsby-mdx`
- `@mdx-js/mdx`
- `@mdx-js/tag`

Later:

- `gatsby-plugin-styled-components`
- `styled-components`
- `babel-plugin-styled-components`

Files to change:

- `gatsby-node.js`
- `gatsby-config.js`
- `index.js`
- `blog-post.js`

## `gatsby-node.js`

Change all markdown remark occurrences with MDX, that's the initial
GraphQL query in create pages, then again in the result

```mdx
