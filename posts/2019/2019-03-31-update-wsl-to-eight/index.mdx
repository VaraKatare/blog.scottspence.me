## Already use WSL with Ubuntu? Want an Upgrade??

I found this post on [dev.to] this weekend detailing going from
version 18.04 to 18.10 on Ubuntu fro Windows Subsystem Linux

I tried it myself and got in a bit of trouble, you can see by checking
out the comments on [David's post]

https://askubuntu.com/questions/1119301/your-system-is-unable-to-reach-the-snap-store

If, like me you uninstalled Ubuntu and tried to reinstall it and are
getting errors like this:

![error installing ubuntu](./derp-install.gif)

Then what worked for me was to restart the `LxssManager` via a
PowerShell console with admin rights.

```powershell
Get-Service LxssManager | Restart-Service
```

## Wrap up!
