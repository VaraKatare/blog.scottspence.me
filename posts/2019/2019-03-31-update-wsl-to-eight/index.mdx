## Already use WSL with Ubuntu? Want an Upgrade??

This is a guide that will cover upgrading Windows Subsystem Linux
(WSL) from the current LTS version to the latest normal version 18.10.

I found this post on [dev.to] this weekend detailing going from
version 18.04 to 18.10 on Ubuntu for Windows Subsystem Linux. You will
know form [earlier posts from me] that trying to go the update route
on WSL is time consuming and you're basically better off starting
again.

I tried it myself and got in a bit of trouble, you can see by checking
out the comments on [David's post]

So from uninstalling my version of Ubuntu I went ahead and tried
again, if you have read the comment's on [David's post] you'll see
that I came up against an issue with

```bash
sudo nano /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades
```

Set the default prompt behaviour to `normal` before using the upgrade
command:

```bash
sudo do-release-upgrade
```

I will always go with the maintainers version of any packages

If, like me, you uninstalled Ubuntu and tried to reinstall it and are
getting errors like this:

![error installing ubuntu](./derp-install.gif)

Then what worked for me was to restart the `LxssManager` via a
PowerShell console with admin rights.

```powershell
Get-Service LxssManager | Restart-Service
```

## Wrap up!
