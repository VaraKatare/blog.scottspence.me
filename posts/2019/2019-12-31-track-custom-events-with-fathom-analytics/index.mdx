At the end of last month (November 2019) I started using [Fathom
Analytics] in place of Google Analytics.

I wanted a simpler way to track visitors to my sites and Fathom offers
that with a great really intuitive interface and simple design.

Fathom copy:

You don't need to display those pesky cookie notices as we don't use
cookies, nor do we track invasive data.

We offer simple, straight-forward website analytics.

We are focused on privacy for website visitors, we don't track them,
save their personal information, or need it to be profitable.

We have hundreds of customers and track tens of millions of page views
per month, so we may be a small company, but we're doing big things.

We can handle viral content without breaking a sweat, so your site
won't slow down because of us, an we don't ever stop tracking you
because of a spike in popularity.

We've been featured in Fast Company as a great alternative to Google
Analytics. All of our plans allow for unlimited websites to be tracked
and receive our top-notch customer support.

Do you use Google Analytics (GA) for any of your sites?

I've used it in the past and it gives quite good information about

Let's talk about Google Analytics, what is it used for

Tracking Events

Privacy Policy

We're going to use the React context API

```js
import React, { createContext, useContext, useEffect } from 'react';

const AnalyticsContext = createContext({});

export const AnalyticsProvider = ({ children }) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    if (typeof window.fathom === 'undefined') {
      window.fathom = (x, y, z) => {
        console.log(`I'm a fake Fathom`, x, y, z);
      };
    }
  }, []);

  const events = {
    logNavigation: goalId => {
      window.fathom('trackGoal', goalId, 0);
    },
  };
  return (
    <AnalyticsContext.Provider value={events}>
      {children}
    </AnalyticsContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useAnalytics = () => {
  return useContext(AnalyticsContext);
};
```

As high up the component tree as possible, add the provider.

```js
import { AnalyticsProvider } from '../contexts/fathom-event-tracking';
```

Then use in the areas you want passing in the Fathom Goal you created.

```js
export const NavItems = () => {
  const analytics = useAnalytics();
  return (
    <>
      <NavLink
        href={`#about`}
        onClick={() => analytics.logNavigation('RC4QULF8')}>
        About
      </NavLink>
      <NavLink
        href={`#portfolio`}
        onClick={() => analytics.logNavigation('H9UEFCBF')}>
        Portfolio
      </NavLink>
    </>
  );
};
```
