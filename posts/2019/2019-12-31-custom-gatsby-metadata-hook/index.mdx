## Hooks ahoy!

Ok, let's get it on with the new hotness in Reactland, React Hooks!
This is a guide covering using the Gatsby custom React hook for
`StaticQuery` which it replaces with `useStaticQuery`.

If you haven't used Gatsby before `StaticQuery` is just that, a way to
query static data in a Gatsby component (i.e. a react component) or a
Gatsby page. This is a great use case for data that doesn't change a
great deal, like your site metadata.

## tl;dr

**Here's a video:**

<Player url={'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWay-LjXwbk'} />

The `StaticQuery` component uses the [render prop] pattern, which
means it takes in a function and returns/renders based off of that.

I have detailed this pattern before in a post about [using the react
context api], it's a component that you pass a function to, to render
a component.

Think of it like this:

```jsx
<Component>
 {() => ()}
</Component>
```

The first parenthesis is the arguments/variables and the second is
what gets rendered, so in the case of the Gatsby `StaticQuery` you
pass a query with a `graphql` tag and then the `data` that comes back
from that is what is used in the render of that component. So you have
your wrapping component that returns and renders a child component,
like this.

```jsx
<WrappingComponent>{args => <ComponentToRender />}</WrappingComponent>
```

```js
import { StaticQuery, graphql } from 'gatsby'

const Layout = ({ children, data }) => (
  <>
    <Header siteTitle={data.site.siteMetadata.title} />
    <Wrapper>{children}</Wrapper>
    <Footer />
  </>
)

export default props => (
  <StaticQuery
    query={graphql`
      query SITE_TITLE_QUERY {
        site {
          siteMetadata {
            title
          }
        }
      }
    `}
    render={data => <Layout data={data} {...props} />}
  />
)
```

### Versions:

I recently created a custom hook component to make use of Gatsby's own
`useStaticQuery` hook in my projects and thought I'd share it with
everyone else.

Here's me trying to even with [codesandbox.io] whilst I convert some
of the Gatsby default starter that's on [codesandbox.io] to use the
custom `useSiteMetadata` function.

Using [codesandbox.io] we take a look at implementing a custom react
hook for getting site metadata in Gatsby.

```js
import { graphql, useStaticQuery } from 'gatsby'

const useSiteMetadata = () => {
  const { site } = useStaticQuery(
    graphql`
      query SITE_METADATA_QUERY {
        site {
          siteMetadata {
            title
            description
            author
          }
        }
      }
    `
  )
  return site.siteMetadata
}

export default useSiteMetadata
```
