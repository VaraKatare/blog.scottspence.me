I've been wanting to go to a JAMstack conf since the first one was
scheduled for October 2018. This year when it was announced there
would be one in London I was super excited to get the opportunity to
go.

The conference was across two days with the first consisting of
workshops, lightning talks and welcome drinks. The second was the
keynote and conference talks either side of a lightning round with
some exciting announcements.

## Tuesday - 2019-07-09

First up was the workshop events where I was attending a workshop on
schema stitching with GraphQL using GraphCMS and Moltin

## Workshop

Jesse was a great at going through the basics of the headless CMS and
why you should be using one. The workshop consisted of us defining our
CMS content model with pen and paper before creating them in the
GraphCMS UI for use with the Moltin eComerce API

### Technical difficulties

There were issues on both the GraphCMS and the Moltin side, mainly
around the UI for Moltin. We all managed to breeze through these
keeping a good pace on the content.

### GraphQL Schema Stitching

Once we all got through the initial setup on our projects it was quite
satisfying to get to two schemas in one query. I still have a bit of
work to do on my project as we all ran out of time towards the end.
Jesse covered the main goal of the workshop which was to stitch the
two schemas together. The additional UI work I can pick up at a later
date.

## Lightning Talks

After the workshops it was time for the lightening talks.

[@jamiebradley234] did a talk on the booming tech scene in
Middlesbrough.
