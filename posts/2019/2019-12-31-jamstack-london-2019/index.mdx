I've been wanting to go to a JAMstack conf since the first one was
scheduled for October 2018. This year when it was announced there
would be one in London I was super excited to get the opportunity to
go.

The conference was across two days with the first consisting of
workshops, lightning talks and welcome drinks. The second was the
keynote and conference talks either side of a lightning round with
some exciting announcements.
