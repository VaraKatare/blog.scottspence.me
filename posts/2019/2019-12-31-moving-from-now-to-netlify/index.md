Basically I moved my whole dev workflow from now to Netlify, why? Well
in my opinion it was just a much nicer workflow

The now ecosystem although genius was a lot of configuration that I
could do without. Contract this against Netlify which almost seems
like zero config, but it's not (Zeit will have you believe now is zero
config, it's really not) but the UI is easy to understand and
intuitive enough not to need documentation, another area where now is
particularly lacking.
